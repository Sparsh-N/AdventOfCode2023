# Advent of Code Submissions for 2023

I've never done advent of code before, so here's my first shot at it!

I'll be working on most of my solutions in Java or Python. I'm aiming to get at least 10 solutions in this year, hopefully completing it fully in next year's AoC! (Finals, unfortunately, interrupted my plans of doing everything perfectly)

I'm learning a bunch of other stuff this break, so I'll most likely finish the first parts only.
